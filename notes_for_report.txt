cant resolve ssm-secure in cf templates
lambda deployment is horrible
abstraction of codepipeline makes it very hard to debug
stupid zip of github means cant make dynamic git updates during pipeline
codepipeline doesnt go to next stage when lambda is finished, api call has to be made
shit integration with github. Surely should have pull requests within codedeploy
aws seems to be basing the deployments not based on git branch but on testing. But how do you then review code? this seems shit 
why for cf stack does the template have to be in s3. why. how do you automate this now?
with so many rapid commits, it makes no sense to have to initialise a codebuild instance every time
automatic deployment puts way too much trust in automated tested - no flexibility for the way of working
seems to say only use one checkout but then you need to change the name

tbf is quite good for severless deployment 
this is just fucking shit. AWS are arseholes. WHY DOES THE CF SCRIPT HAVE TO BE IN S3?! twats. so it isnt kept in codecommit as it needs to be in s3 and obviously you cant have more than one source for a pipeline. just use jenkins smh
